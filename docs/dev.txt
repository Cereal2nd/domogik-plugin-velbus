Timeout on sensors
==================

The timeout is set to 0 for all sensors : as the interval between 2 checks is a global parameter, we can't set a proper default timeout. If needed, the timeout should be set manually by the user for this plugin.

How it the disk space data calculated ?
=======================================

The plugin just use the ``os.statvfs(path)`` function.
